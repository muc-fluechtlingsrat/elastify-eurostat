### If you think that our numbers are wrong

If you find numbers that make no sense, please tell the github user ynux. 
Please include the other source of information that contradicts our number (unless it's obvious nonsense).

Known issues:
* numbers are slightly off, by about 5%, 
* something is wrong with the numbers around 1995

Also, newer numbers can be too low, because some members haven't reported their statistics to eurostat yet. These values should be really be NULL, but appear as zero in our sums.

We did encounter issues with way too high numbers (e.g. double, caused by counting every geo, and then add the Total), and low numbers (e.g. caused by a run that stopped before it completed). 
Obviously, we cannot guarantee anything. We encourage doublechecking in eurostat's data browser.
